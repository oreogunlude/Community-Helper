# Shopper Helper

A Figma prototype for a community shopping application with free delivery on all grocery orders made within a specific locationâ€™s radius. 
The purpose of this application is to help members in same the community buy items for each other. 

## Application Functions

### Toggle View

Shopper Helper allows its users to toggle between being a shopper (needing help with shopping) and a helper (helping those in need). 
Once the app is launched, the user is required to pick a role on the app which then leads to the home page.

### Shopper Mode

As a Shopper the user gets free delivery on all items they buy due to the kindness of their fellow helping members in their neighborhood! 

A Shopper can pick a variety of items from different stores around them and their neighbors could help them to deliver those items if they also happen to be going to that store. When a Shopper creates a shopping list, the Helpers in the community going to that that location get notified and can decide whether they are able to help deliver these items.

### Helper Mode

As a Helper the user is considered a super-hero in their community! This incredible individual has taken it upon themselves to assist neighbours who need help delivering their orders free of charge.

A Helper can decide which Shopper to help based on the Helper's transportation mode, store location, convenience and several other factors -- based on the Helpers discretion. As soon as a Helper picks the store location they are going to, the Helper receives a list of Shoppers who need assistance delivering their ordered items. The Helper chooses from the list whichever orders they can help with.

### Transfer Of Funds

Shoppers are only charged when there is a Helper who has agreed to deliver the order made. The Helper receives the funds to buy the order at the store location when they agree to deliver an order.

To prevent fraudulent behaviour the maximum dollar amount of orders that can be agreed to by the Helper per day is $2500. In a situation where a delivery was not made by the Helper, a dispute is filed with the payment service provider to request a refund and the Helpers account is suspended until the dispute has been resolved. 

Shoppers are allowed to tip their Helpers after a successful delivery.
